  <h1>Royal Game of Ur</h1>


  <dialog>
    <p>The Royal Game of Ur dates back over 4600 years to the city of Ur in ancient Mesopotamia. Many different rules
      were probably played since then, but the Finkel ruleset is the most popular today.

    <ul>
      <li>Goal: Score all your pieces before your opponent!</li>
      <li>Roll Dice: Players take turns rolling the game's unique dice.</li>
      <li>Move: Select a piece to move by the number of tiles you rolled.</li>
      <li>Capture: Land on a piece to capture it, sending it back to the start.</li>
      <li>Rosettes: The rosette tiles grant safety and an additional roll!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rule 1 Game Setup</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Clear the game baord.</li>
      <li>players start with seven piece each.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Rule 2 Roll the Dice</h3>
    <p>The unique tetrahedral dice used for the Royal Game of Ur are read by counting the number of die with a marked
      corner facing upwards after rolling.</p>

    <h3>Rule 3 Move your Pieces</h3>
    <p>After rolling, select one of your pieces to move by the number of tiles that you rolled. One player moves their
      pieces along the path shown below, and the other player follows a vertically mirrored path. Your turn can only be
      skipped if you have no available moves. Otherwise, you must move a piece!</p>

    <h3>Rule 4 Capture Pieces</h3>
    <p>You can capture your opponent's pieces by moving your pieces on top of their pieces! Capturing your opponent's
      pieces is a great way to slow the progress of your opponent. Beware though, under the Finkel ruleset, the rosette
      tiles are safe tiles! This means that you cannot capture pieces on rosettes.</p>

    <h3>Rule 5 Rosette Tiles</h3>
    <p>The rosette tiles are the most important tiles on the board of the Royal Game of Ur! As a symbol of the goddess
      Ishtar, they provide benefits to players who land upon them. Under the rules proposed by Irving Finkel, landing on
      a rosette tile gives you the following benefits:</p>

    <h3>Rule 6 Score your Pieces</h3>
    <p>Winning requires you to score all your pieces! You can score pieces by moving them off the board at the end of
      your path. You need an exact roll to take a piece off the board. For example, to score a piece from the final
      rosette tile, you would need to roll exactly a one.</p>
